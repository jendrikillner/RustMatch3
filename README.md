# RustMatch3
The Code for the Rust Game series by [Jendrik Illner](https://www.jendrikillner.com)

Going to make a simple “Match 3” game from scratch.

My goals for the final project result are

- Implement full game-flow (Menus, Options, Loading, Gameplay, Pause screen, etc.)
- Multiple levels
- Save game system
- Audio (Music and Sound Effects)

Constraints
- Windows only
- fixed resolution
- D3D11 renderer
- using no external crates at runtime, besides winapi

What the final game might look like
